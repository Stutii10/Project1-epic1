# Project1-Epic5

To compile and run the project, use the following commands:

```bash
cobc -x -o uid InCollege.cob     
./uid
```
This will compile the COBOL source file `InCollege.cob` and create an executable named `uid`, which you can then run.
Make sure you have a COBOL compiler installed on your system to execute these commands successfully.

PLEASE REMOVE ALL THE .dat file before each testcase.

If you would like to run the test cases all at once, ensure that you are in the test directory in your terminal, and then you can use the following command:

```bash
python3 test.py
```
