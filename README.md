# Project1-Epic6

Job/Internship Posting (Epic 6 core)

1. Post a job/internship with required fields. Persist each posting to JobPostings.dat in a single line record.

2. Job Browsing: List all posted jobs/internships from JobPostings.dat.Display title, employer, location, salary (or NONE), poster username, and description.

3. Connections â€“ Requests and Actions, Send connection requests from profile search results.View pending requests addressed to the logged-in user.Accept or reject each pending request, with status persisted.

4. My Network View: List all accepted connections for the logged-in user. If a profile exists for the connection, show basic profile summary.

To compile and run the project, use the following commands:

```bash
cobc -x -o uid InCollege.cob     
./uid
```
This will compile the COBOL source file `InCollege.cob` and create an executable named `uid`, which you can then run.
Make sure you have a COBOL compiler installed on your system to execute these commands successfully.

PLEASE REMOVE ALL THE .dat file before each testcase.
