# Project1-Epic5

To compile and run the project, use the following commands:

```bash
cobc -x -o uid InCollege.cob     
./uid
```
This will compile the COBOL source file `InCollege.cob` and create an executable named `uid`, which you can then run.
Make sure you have a COBOL compiler installed on your system to execute these commands successfully.

PLEASE REMOVE ALL THE .dat file before each testcase.
